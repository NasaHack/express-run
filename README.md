# Express App Starter CLI Tool

Run the following command:

```bash
npx run-express
```

- Enter a **project name** when prompted.
- If the folder already exists, you’ll be asked to choose a different name.
- The commands will automatically:
  - Clone my personal [run-express](https://github.com/NasaHack/express-run) repository.
  - Install dependencies.
  - Open the project in **VS Code** (if installed) or in the default file manager.

Example Output:

```bash
🔍 Enter project name: my-new-project
🎉 Project 'my-new-project' cloned successfully! 🚀
🎉 Project opened successfully. 🚀
```
