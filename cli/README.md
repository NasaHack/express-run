# Express App Starter CLI Tool

Run the following command:

```bash
npx run-express
```

- Enter a **project name** when prompted.
- If the folder already exists, you‚Äôll be asked to choose a different name.
- The commands will automatically:
  - Clone my personal [run-express](https://github.com/NasaHack/express-run) repository.
  - Install dependencies.
  - Open the project in **VS Code** (if installed) or in the default file manager.
